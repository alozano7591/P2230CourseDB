School DB:
This is going to be a very basic db of students and classes

Each Course will have many students, and a student can have many courses

Each course has many books. A book can belong to only one course



Diagram something like this:


  book
    |
    |
 1 course to many
    |                           
  Course <---(has many)--> students


courses linked to students thru enrollment


THINGS TO DO:
- get tag helpers working with last action message 
- get passwords and authorization working
- see if you can find out how to check if input email or number already exists on db (initialization attribute maybe?)
